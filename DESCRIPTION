Description: NxtIRFdata is a companion package for SpliceWiz, an interactive
    analysis and visualization tool for alternative splicing quantitation
    (including intron retention) for RNA-seq BAM files. NxtIRFdata contains 
    Mappability files required for the generation of human and mouse references.
    NxtIRFdata also contains a synthetic genome reference and example BAM files 
    used to demonstrate SpliceWiz's functionality. 
	BAM files are based on 6 samples from the Leucegene dataset provided by 
    NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE67039.
